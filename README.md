# Adventure-game-udacity-project
a required project using Python in Udacity's intro to programming course

The purpose of the project is to make a simpler version of an old-fashioned text-based adventure game using python.

# **The requirements of the project:**

 - The game gives players a description of what's happening, pausing between printing descriptions and then asking them to make a choice.
-   Something different happens depending on the choice the player made.
-   The game also includes some random factors, so that it's a little different each time.
-   The game has conditions for winning and losing.
-   When the game is over, it asks if the player wants to play again.  
- It checks for valid inputs.
- The code is refactored.


## My chosen scenario:
- I choose a random choice of the Monster and a set weapon (sword).
